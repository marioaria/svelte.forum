# svelte.forum

A personal learning project with the potential of becoming something somewhat useful one day. The goal is to learn Svelte and Git by building something other than a todo app. I decided to create a forum with Svelte and SvelteKit for myself and other Svelte developers. This way, I can have a place to ask stupid questions without the fear of being banned or downvoted into oblivion.
